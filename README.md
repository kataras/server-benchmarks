# Server Benchmarks

A benchmark suite which, **transparently**, stress-tests web servers and generates a report in markdown. It measures the requests per second, data transferred and time between requests and responses.

## Why YABS (Yet Another Benchmark Suite)

It's true, there already enough of benchmark suites to play around. However, most of them don't even contain real-life test applications to benchmark, therefore the results are not always accurate e.g. a route handler executes SQL queries or reads and sends JSON. This benchmark suite is a fresh start, it can contain any type of tests as the tests are running as self-executables and the measuring is done by a popular and trusted 3rd-party software which acts as a real HTTP Client (one more reason of transparency). [Contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) and improvements are always welcomed here.

## Use case

Measure the performance of application(s) between different versions or implementations (or web frameworks).

This suite can be further customized, through its [tests.yml](tests.yml) file, in order to test personal or internal web applications before their public releases.

## Installation

The only requirement for the benchmark tool is the [Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/dl).

```sh
$ go get -u github.com/kataras/server-benchmarks
$ go get -u github.com/codesenberg/bombardier
```

Depending on your test cases you may want to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) and [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) too.

## How to run

1. Navigate to your tests directory, the one which includes a  **tests.yml** file
1. Open a terminal and execute: `server-benchmarks`
2. Wait for the executable _server-benchmarks_ (or _server-benchmarks.exe_ for windows) to finish
3. That's all, now open the the results from the generated **RESULTS.md** file.

### Advanced usage

- Read the tests from the _./tests.dev.yml_ file
- Wait 3 seconds between tests
- Output the results to the _./dev_ directory
- Write the results to a remote [google spreadsheet](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) table, which you can convert to a graph later on (as shown above).

```sh
$ server-benchmarks --wait-run=3s -i ./tests.dev.yml -o ./dev -g-spreadsheet $GoogleSpreadsheetID -g-secret client_secret.json
```

### Run using Docker

The only requirement is [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/).

```sh
$ docker run -v ${PWD}:/data kataras/server-benchmarks
```

## Benchmarks

The following generated README contains benchmark results from builtin tests between popular **HTTP/2 web frameworks as of 2020**.

_Note:_ it's possible that the contents of this file will be updated regularly to accept even more tests cases and frameworks.

## Terminology

**Name** is the name of the framework(or router) used under a particular test.

**Reqs/sec** is the avg number of total requests could be processed per second (the higher the better).

**Latency** is the amount of time it takes from when a request is made by the client to the time it takes for the response to get back to that client (the smaller the better).

**Throughput** is the rate of production or the rate at which data are transferred (the higher the better, it depends from response length (body + headers).

**Time To Complete** is the total time (in seconds) the test completed (the smaller the better).

## Results

### Test:Static

ðŸ“– Fires 1000000 requests, receives a static message as response.
